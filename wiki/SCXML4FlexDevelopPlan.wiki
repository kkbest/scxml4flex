= Flex/ActionScript SCXML enigne project proposal =

We usually use Flex ActionScript to develop some cartoon application, such as some thing move in the screen. Recently, i noticed that SCXML is a good solution for this kind of application, it can control state and transation very well. But sadly i can not get any good ActionScript based SCXML engine, so i want to develop a similar actionscript based SCXML engine.

We have started develop job, and named it SCXML4Flex. It has implemented many SCXML elements:
scxml, state, transition, final, history, parallel, onentry, onexit, data, invoke, log, assign, raise, script, cancel, param, send,if, elseif, else and finish [http://code.google.com/p/scxml4flex/wiki/HowToUseCustomAction CustomAction support]. Now, it can handler basic SCXML service, we can check SCXML4Flex demo [http://scxml4as.appspot.com/ here].

But there is still a long way for SCXML4Flex to be perfect. We have still four parts to work for it, Basic element implementation, XInclude support, XPath support and Event IO processor.


= Future Plan =

==Basic elements implementation==
Add validate,donedate,content,param,finalize support for SCXML4Flex.

==XInclude support==
We usually use XInclude to merge several XML document into one whole document. XInclude includes several attribute, XPointer is the most difficult part for us. I think we can choose a open source XPath engine and finish XPointer and XInclude implementation base on it.

==XPath support==
XPath is a very important component in any XML document and also in SCMXL document.
===The XPath Data Model in SCXML===
In SCXML's [http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/#xpath-profile XPath data model], XPath 2.0 expressions are used to select a node-set from the data model by providing a binding expression. The following example illustrates this usage:
{{{
<state id="errorSwitch">
  <datamodel>
    <data id="cities">
      <list xmlns="">
        <city id="nyc" count="0">New York</city>
        <city id="bos" count="0">Boston</city>
      </list>
    </data>
  </datamodel>
  <onentry>
    <assign location="$cities/list/city[@id='nyc']/@count" expr="1"/>
  </onentry>
</state>
}}}
===Conditional Expressions in SCXML===
XPath 2.0 expressions used in conditional expressions are converted into their effective boolean value as described XPath 2.0 specification. The following example illustrates this usage.
{{{
<state id="errorSwitch" xmlns:fn="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions">
  <datamodel>
    <data id="time"/>
  </datamodel>
          
  <onentry>
    <assign location="$time" expr="fn:current-dateTime()"/>
  </onentry>
          
  <transition cond="fn:year-from-dateTime($time) > 2009" target="newBehavior"/>
  <transition target="currentBehavior"/>
</state>
}}}
In this section, we should finish all the XPath 2.0 functions implementation job.
===XPath in XInclude===
As we mentioned above, XInclude use XPath to build XPointer element.

==Event IO processor==

SCXML's Event I/O Processors includes several components:
SCXML Event I/O Processor, Basic HTTP Event I/O Processor and DOM Event I/O Processor. We can see [http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/#eventioprocessors here] to get more details
