= Flex/ActionScript SCXML enigne project proposal =

We usually use Flex ActionScript to develop some cartoon application, such as some thing move in the screen. Recently, i noticed that [http://www.w3c.org/TR/scxml State Chart XML] is a good solution for this kind of application, it can control state and transation very well. But sadly i can not get any good ActionScript based SCXML engine, so i want to develop a similar actionscript based SCXML engine.

We have started develop job, and named it [http://code.google.com/p/scxml4flex/ SCXML4Flex]. It has implemented many SCXML elements:
scxml, state, transition, final, history, parallel, onentry, onexit, data, invoke, log, assign, raise, script, cancel, param, send,if, elseif, else and finish [http://code.google.com/p/scxml4flex/wiki/HowToUseCustomAction CustomAction support]. Now, it is a usable ActionScript SCXML engine, it can handler basic SCXML service, we can check SCXML4Flex demo [http://scxml4as.appspot.com/ here].

But there is still a long way for SCXML4Flex to be perfect. We have still four parts to work for it, Basic element implementation, XInclude support, XPath support and Event IO processor.


= Future Plan =

==Basic elements implementation==
SCXML4Flex has implemented many elements for SCXML already, but we should go head in this way, there are still some elements that were not implemented yet:
 * validate element
 * donedate element
 * content element 
 * param element
 * finalize element

==System variables implementation==
The Data Module maintains a protected portion of the data model containing information that may be useful to applications. We refer to the items in this special part of the data model as 'system variables'. Implementations must provide the following system variables:
 * {{{_event}}}
 * {{{_sessionid}}}
 * {{{_name}}}
 * {{{_x}}}
The set of system variables may be expanded in future versions of this specification. Variable names beginning with  {{{_}}}  are reserved for system use. Developers must not use ids beginning with  {{{_}}} in the < data > element. We can check [http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/#SystemVariables here] to get more information about system variables.

==XInclude support==
We usually use XInclude to merge several XML document into one whole document. 
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<data xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
		<item><xi:include href="books.xml" xpointer="/bookstore/book[1]/title"/></item>
		<item><xinclude href="books.xml" xpointer="/bookstore/book/price/text()"/></item>
		<item><xinclude href="books.xml" xpointer="/bookstore/book[price>35]/price"/></item>
		<item><xi:include href="books.xml" xpointer="/bookstore/book[price>35]/title"/></item>
	</bookTests>
	<item>data 1</item>
	<item>data 2</item>
	<xinclude href="Test2Doc.xml" xpointer="/path/to/evaluate"/>
	<xi:include href="Test2Doc.xml" xpointer="//*"/>
</data>
}}}
XInclude includes several attribute, XPointer is the most difficult part for us. I think we can choose a open source XPath engine and finish XPointer and XInclude implementation base on it.

==XPath support==
XPath is a very important component in any XML document and also in SCMXL document.
===The XPath Data Model in SCXML===
In SCXML's [http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/#xpath-profile XPath data model], XPath 2.0 expressions are used to select a node-set from the data model by providing a binding expression. The following example illustrates this usage:
{{{
<state id="errorSwitch">
  <datamodel>
    <data id="cities">
      <list xmlns="">
        <city id="nyc" count="0">New York</city>
        <city id="bos" count="0">Boston</city>
      </list>
    </data>
  </datamodel>
  <onentry>
    <assign location="$cities/list/city[@id='nyc']/@count" expr="1"/>
  </onentry>
</state>
}}}
===Conditional Expressions in SCXML===
XPath 2.0 expressions used in conditional expressions are converted into their effective boolean value as described XPath 2.0 specification. The following example illustrates this usage.
{{{
<state id="errorSwitch" xmlns:fn="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions">
  <datamodel>
    <data id="time"/>
  </datamodel>
          
  <onentry>
    <assign location="$time" expr="fn:current-dateTime()"/>
  </onentry>
          
  <transition cond="fn:year-from-dateTime($time) > 2009" target="newBehavior"/>
  <transition target="currentBehavior"/>
</state>
}}}
In this section, we should finish all the XPath 2.0 functions implementation job.
===XPath in XInclude===
As we mentioned above, XInclude use XPath to build XPointer element.

==Event IO processor==

SCXML's Event I/O Processors includes several components:
SCXML Event I/O Processor, Basic HTTP Event I/O Processor and DOM Event I/O Processor. We can see [http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/#eventioprocessors here] to get more details
